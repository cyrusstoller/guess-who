## Learn some names!

This is a simple game that allows you to guess the names of people.

This is a fork of https://github.com/cyrusstoller/guess-the-stack

### For development

```bash
$ shotgun config.ru
```

### Without reloading between requests

```bash
$ rackup config.ru
```

### Deployment

```bash
cap production deploy:setup
cap production deploy
```

###	Deployment Using Docker

Please make sure your host machine has ``Docker`` and ``docker-compose`` installed and ``db`` file inside your ``data`` directory

To run this project, do the following:

	docker-compose build
	docker-compose up

Now, go to port 9292 and you are done!

You can also use these files with your existing project. Copy, ``docker-compose.yml`` and ``Dockerfile`` to the root directory of your project. Now, run:

	docker-compose build
	docker-compose up

Like before, your app is now running on port 9292 of your host machine. What if I want to change this? Easy enough. Currently, in docker-compose, we are exposing 9292:9292. The one on the left is our host's port and the one on the right is Docker container port.

To change the host port, say 80, change it to 80:9292. Now, you can go to the root of your host-ip and look at your awesome dashboard!

## Database schema

The sqlite file should live in

> data/people.sqlite3.db

A sample file can be found in

> data/sample.sqlite3.db

For a quick start you can run:

```bash
$ ln -s data/sample.sqlite3.db data/people.sqlite3.db
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE "groups" (
	`id`	INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	`name`	TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE "people" (
	`id`			INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
	`name`			TEXT,
	`web_url`		TEXT,
	`description`	TEXT,
	`thumbnail`		TEXT,
	`group_id`		INTEGER
);
```

For now, to load data from a csv:

- First remove the `id` column

```
sqlite3 data/people.sqlite3.db
.mode csv
.import 'raw.csv' people
```

- Add the `id` column back
- I plan on adding a rake task for this in the future

### Bugs / Issues

If you find a bug or something that could improve the user experience, please file an issue on this github project, so contributors/maintainers can get started fixing them. :-)

Even if you plan on filing a patch for the issue yourself it'd be great if you could still file an issue so that we don't have people duplicating work unnecessarily.
